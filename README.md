# Project Setup Instructions

This project consists of a machine learning backend and a React frontend. Follow the steps below to set up and run both components.

---

## Backend: WhisperLive

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment tools (e.g., `venv`, `virtualenv`)
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies and models

### Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the `WhisperLive` Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd WhisperLive
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   Install all the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the ML Model:**
   Install the Whisper model from Hugging Face:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
   pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper
   pip install git+https://github.com/makubacki/faster-whisper
   ```

   Then, download the specific model:
   ```bash
   from faster_whisper import Whisper
   model = Whisper("https://huggingface.co/Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3")
   ```

5. **Configure `start_backend.sh`:**
   If necessary, update the script to activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Example for Linux/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   python app.py
   ```

   Ensure that the script points to the correct virtual environment paths.

6. **Run the Backend:**
   Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   bash start_backend.sh
   ```

## Frontend: court-proto

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (16.x or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the `court-proto` Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd court-proto
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install all required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Build for Production:**
   If deploying, build the application for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Additional Notes

- **Backend Port:** Ensure that the backend is running on the expected port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`) as required by the React application. Modify the React app configuration if needed.
- **Frontend API Endpoint:** Verify that the React app is configured to point to the correct backend URL.
- **Environment Variables:** Use `.env` files in both `WhisperLive` and `court-proto` folders for storing sensitive information like API keys or configuration parameters.
- **License:** Include a license if applicable.

---

### Troubleshooting

1. **Backend Virtual Environment Issues:**
   - Ensure the `venv` activation path is correct in `start_backend.sh`.
   - Verify Python dependencies are installed.

2. **Frontend Issues:**
   - Ensure `node_modules` is installed (`npm install`).
   - Verify that the React app's API endpoints match the backend's URLs.

3. **Model Installation Errors:**
   - Check your internet connection.
   - Ensure the `faster-whisper` package is properly installed.
